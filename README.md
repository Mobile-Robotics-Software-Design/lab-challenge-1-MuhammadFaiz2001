A reflection document answering the following questions:

a. Do you think ROS is beneficial for developing a robotic application? Explain your answer.
  In the near future thier might be a time where not everyone has access to resources to fiddle around with robotic parts to create an interest in the field or even at jobs people might need to work on templates before they move on to real life robots. When that time comes ROS would be very beneficial as it would allows kids to work on them from thier computers instead of getting all the parts and putting them together which can be a hassle.

b. Why is using a simulator important in Robotics?
A simulator allows us to test our robot in real-world applications and also see where we might be going wrong instead of just looking at a bunch of words. It would also help us make it better because we can test it in a better enviroment.

c. Briefly describe the RoboMaker platform. Also, list its strength and weak points in your
personal opinion.
The RoboMaker platform allows its users to simulate thier own created robots using ROS to a simulation enviroment.
Some of the strengths RoboMaker has are the following:
1. Easy to Access
2. Fun to use
3. No requirement of real life tools or tests
4. Easier and faster paced tests
5. No problems occuring in the hardware

Some of the weaknesses RoboMaker has are the following:
1. Paid-Platform
2. Dosent allow kids to really fall in love with the hardware aspect of development
3. Not as widely used in highschools compared to actual hardware
